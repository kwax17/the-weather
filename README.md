# Weather Dashboard

This application functions to show users the weather both currenly and for the next 5 days so that trips or the day itself are more easily planned.  The user inputs the city they want to view, and the info appears.  It is then saved to the top locations, which already display example cities.  When either the example cities or previously searched cities are clicked on, the info appears again on the main sceen. 

## Other Apps Used

To create this application, I also used jQuery, Bootstrap, Moment.js, and Open Weather API. jQuery and Bootstrap both are tools for JavaScript and CSS, respectively, and reduce the lines of coding for both programs. Moment.js is how the dates appear, both on the current day and for the future forecast.  The Open Weathern API was called 3 different times for the current weather, current uv index, and future forecast.  This API returns the weather for each circumstance.
